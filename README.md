# Reducing Plastic Waste to Protect Oceans and Wildlife

##  Overview

This project is a straightforward, interactive website created to increase public awareness of the detrimental effects that plastic waste has on the environment, wildlife, and oceans. The project informs users about how minor lifestyle adjustments can have a significant impact on the environment through interactive images, buttons, and interesting facts.

##  Features

* **Interactive Images & Buttons**: Every image draws attention to a distinct problem (e.g., single-use plastics, endangered marine life, or the hidden costs of waste).
* **Educational Fun Facts**: Startling information about energy use, wildlife, forests, and water.
* **Responsive Layout**:  This layout, which includes a navigation bar and a flexible container design, is styled with CSS to work across devices.
* **Call to Action**: Promotes awareness-raising and the adoption of reusable alternatives by users.
  
##  Goal

The purpose of this project is to combine the art of web design with green campaigning. By making the experience interactive and informative, the project will try to make people reduce their use of plastics and take cognizance of the greater impact of wastage on our planet.
