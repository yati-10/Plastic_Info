  <p class="fun">Fun Fact:</p>
    <p class="fun"> Water and Waste
      <ul>A single leaking faucet dripping once per second can waste over 165 gallons of water in a month. That's more water than a person drinks in two weeks!</ul>

    <ul>It takes about 2,700 liters of water to make a single cotton t-shirt.</ul>

    <ul>Recycling one aluminum can saves enough energy to power a TV for about three hours.</ul>

    <ul>A glass bottle can take up to 1 million years to decompose in the environment.</ul></p>

    <p class="fun"> Forests and Wildlife
      <ul>Every day, around 27,000 trees are cut down just to make toilet paper.</ul>

    <ul>The world's combined weight of all ants is greater than the combined weight of all humans.</ul>

    <ul>78% of marine mammals are at risk of accidental death from plastic garbage and fishing nets in the ocean.</ul></p>

    <p class="fun"> Energy
      <ul>When you turn on an old-fashioned incandescent light bulb, 90% of the energy is wasted as heat, with only 10% actually producing light.</ul>

    <ul>Some new refrigerators are so energy-efficient they use less electricity than a light bulb.</ul>

    <ul>It takes more energy to make one kilogram of paper than it does to make one kilogram of steel.</ul></p>
